# Visualforce

Visualforce is the foundation for salesforce pages. It is similar to ASP.NET where tags are created on the back-end, and contain programatic elements either pre-defined or built by a dev. Or, it can be compared to the likes of php and python *flask* combined. It works with a the language: [Apex](./apex.md).

## Syntax:

Just like html, you can set parameters to VF tags.

## Visualforce expressions:

You can retrieve variables from your database using `{! $variable.value }` syntax. Expressions are case-insensitive, and can be concatinated through `&`.
