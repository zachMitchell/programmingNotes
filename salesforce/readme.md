# Salesforce

Salesforce is what's called a CRM (Customer Relations Management) system. From my understanding, this is a full-stack suite that basically covers everything for you: front-end, back-end, database, and the servers themselves. It comes pre-installed with a few things, but the *real* fun comes when you start making something with all the pieces they have in place. (User system, pre-defined objects,etc)

The platform has two proprietary languages that will be documented here:
1. [Apex](./apex.md)
1. [Visualforce](./visualforce.md)
