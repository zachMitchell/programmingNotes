Trailhead DX is a two-day crash course on everything salesforce! I got to attend this, and as of this writing, my schedule is booked XP

[(Website)](https://www.salesforce.com/trailheadx/)

## Choose the Right tool for your next automation job
**Topic:** Lightning flow

* Consumers, devs and administrators love seamless experiences.
    * The more simple something is to the end-user, the more complex it is to make.
* Flow builder is a simplistic system that helps starts you off with macro-like processes
* process builder helps create more complex systems, and even let's you execute apex triggers.
    * There's a new ability available for this feature! You can create applications for appExchange that let's you use process builder!


## Designing Mobile Apps for iOS

This is a talk by Mark Malone from apple!

* Aestetic is important for your app. You wanna stay relevant with your app. You don't really want to keep it in archaic times.
    * Design also spans into usability as well. You want it to "just work" [;P] without much explanation
    * Familiar icons are also usefull for that "just works" element.
    * Animations are important for design too. They help guide the user gently to what happens next.
    * Becuase of the advancements of usability, people of all ages can use interfaces of today.
* Preditcabiltiy helps you create something an end-user would expect from your design.
* inlcusivity is helpfull for when people need accessiblity options.
    * From another thing I saw, it really does empower somebody who wouldn't normally use the app. It makes them capable of things they couldn't before.
    * common examples include color-blindess, font enlargment, and voiceOver
* usability: making full use of all the device's capabilties.
    * if something is tricky to solve using pure code, making use of the hardware capablities could help you solve a tricky problem.
    * Apple has machine learning API's already created so you can get started quickly.
* Apple has a site called "human interface guidelines".
    * salesforce Mobile SDK 7.1

## Salesforce DX cheatsheet

* SFDX is a suite of tools to make things easier for devs.
* Basically anything that's usefull to the developer is part of this "DX" :P
* Scratch vs sandbox:
    * scratch orgs are designed to be built from the ground up, mostly used for experiments
    * sandboxes are designed to have something ready to go.

## Js tips and tricks

* With constants, you cannot derive away from the original referenced object. Basically that means you can add elements to an array because the *array* is referenced, not the elment (This could also apply to objects)
* [array.every()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray/every), [array.find()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find)
* rest:
    * the spread operator [...] appends and extracts array elements into one array.
    * destructuring syntax: this can be used to query certain objects while creating a new object at the same time
        *  this technique can also be used in arrays.

## a practical guide for turning a commodore 64 into a photo booth
* MuleSoft: conect *anything*
* The idea was to connect polar opposites: the c64, and the internet... by the POWER OF MULESOFT
* this guy could figure out the c64 from it's exhaustive guide that's included with every c64.
* in order to connect the c64, they created a custom cable!
