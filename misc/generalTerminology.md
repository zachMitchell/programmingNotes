# General Terminology

## Abstract classes
This is a template to tie in related objects together; for example: shape would be an abstract class for square and circle.

### syntax (java)
```java
abstract class shape{
private int number = 5 //Anything using this abstract class can use and change the number for their own purposes.

public abstract void method();//Abstract classess can have abstract methods, which are like theoretical methods that can abe exuecuted if the extended class has modified it.
}
```
regular methods can be inserted into abstract classes as well.

## %
For some reason, i've never completely understood %. I made use of it a few times, having a hunch it would make my program work, but that's just intuition... I'm going to explain it.

% is the remainder of a division problem. for example: 5 / 2 is 2, remainder 1. therefore
5 % 2 = 1

Based on randomness experiments, the remainder will ALWAYS be between 0, and the divisor.

any number that you will come accross that isn't even with the divisor will always come to the above cirteria.
