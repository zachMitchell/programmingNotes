# NC files

nc files contain information about wheather, as described in [The python equivelent notes](../python/netcdf.md) [Hey! that was cool :D]. These programs are designed for the end user to open NC files:

1. **ncview ./path/to/file.nc** View a visual representation of all the data.
1. **ncdump [-v variableName] ./path/to/file.nc** Dumps the entire file (or selected values) to the console
1. **nco** edit an nc file. Not really sure how to use this...
