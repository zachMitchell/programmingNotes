Welcome to my personal notebook! Before you are folders of things I've learned over the course of time. If I ever need to go back to using another language or look at cringe & typos... It's right here!

Writing notes on github mainly helps me solve a portability issue where I want to view my notes on a wide range of devices, headless or not. It's also fast because it's plain text. I also don't need extras like drawing or moving text in arbitrary locations on the screen.

## Setup
I'm editing my notes with VSCode most of the time. More recent notes are written in Markdown so it's easy on the eyes.

Visual Studio Code has a feature where you can preview markdown by pressing **CTRL+SHIFT+V** while on the document, so I usually have that turned on whilist writing.

**Github** Obviously has syntax hylighting, so it makes the perfect fit. In addition, I'm using their version of Markdown called [GDM](https://enwp.org/Markdown#GFM)

## History

Mainly this is a hodgepodge of old notes from boostnote.io (forever ago), random scraps of txt files from various machines, and possibly a hint of old oneNote pages... I forget by now

Some of these notes are really old; if I want to jump back into a language, there will probably need to be updates to ceratin places. As of this writing I'm actively looking at JS material & godot, so those will be the most up to date.
