Hello! This isn't an ordinary project. What you are currently viewing is a big repository of notes that I've accumulated over the past few years. It includes to-the-point content about many languages like javascript, c++, bash, take your pick! I'm constantly learning, and in turn, this repository grows, so stop on by and get straight to the beef!

Oh yeah, and don't try executing these, they won't work XD

## Ideal Setup
I'm editing my notes with visual studio code. More recent notes are written in Markdown so it's easy on the eyes.

Visual Studio Code has a feature where you can preview markdown by pressing **CTRL+SHIFT+V** while on the document, so I usually have that turned on whilist writing.

**Github** Obviously has syntax hylighting, so it makes the perfect fit. In addition, I'm using their version of Markdown called [GDM](https://enwp.org/Markdown#GFM)

## aaaaaand...why?
Well it all started with this interesting program called [boostnote](http://boostnote.io). I used this program religously because of how well I could write there. The novelty of having syntax hylighting while reading about your favorite language was quite intruiging. It also worked across all the popular operating systems, so hey! It checked out :D

...until I wanted my notes in tougher nooks and crannys. On top of that, I also have a ton of notes from school, and they arn't in propper format either... worst of all: they're in **oneNote** (SHUDDER)

OneNote wouldn't be so bad, except it's more on the proprietary side. I can't just stick oneNote on linux; the whole time I was at school, I just made use of the web app.

So that's why i'm here now! I'm going to go through all of my notes taken (OneNote will be the hardest), place them here, and have the most portable solution out there that will even work on mobile or terminals :)

**TLDR: countless methods of note-taking have been boiled down to this repo instead of just sticking my notes in arbitrary locations.**

So yeah. Enjoy!
